Got it. You have 85 days to turn "27 km hilly virtual" into "100 km hilly outdoors with dignity intact". We'll do it with three levers:

1. Consistency (your biggest limiter right now, but also the easiest win)
2. Long-ride progression (time in the saddle, not hero watts)
3. Cadence + pacing (so climbs don't feel like repeated small murders)

Below: (1) analysis, (2) a 12-week plan Feb 22 → May 17, (3) a simple strength/mobility routine, (4) fat loss strategy that doesn't sabotage training.

## 1) In-Depth Activity Analysis

### A) Trend and consistency

**What the last 2 months show**

- Until early Feb: mostly 1 session/week. Fitness can't really "stick" with that frequency.
- Weeks W07–W08 jump to 4–6 sessions/week and ~200–400 min/week. That's the first real fitness signal in the dataset.
- Your body is currently in the "newly-employed at the gym" phase: it responds fast, but it also gets cranky if you spike load too hard.

Key risk: your ramp rate is steep (going from almost nothing to 6 activities/week). Good news: you handled it. Next step is making it repeatable.

---

### B) Cycling power: estimated FTP, efficiency, pacing quality

You don't have a formal test, but your virtual rides give enough to estimate.

**Given**

- 88 min Ardennes: 107 W avg, 113 W NP
- 66 min Ardennes: 96 W avg, 124 W NP (big gap)
- Aerobic 12's 63 min: 93 W avg, 100 W NP

**Estimated FTP (rough, practical): 125–140 W**

- If you can ride ~88 min at 107 W, that's commonly around 75–85% of FTP for many riders at your stage.
- 107 / 0.80 ≈ 134 W (middle of the range).

So: FTP ~130 W is a sensible working number for training zones.

**Efficiency / pacing**

The NP vs avg power gap is your big tell:

- Ardennes 88 min: 113 vs 107 (fine, mildly "surgy")
- Ardennes 66 min: 124 vs 96 (very surgy)

That usually means climbs are being ridden too hard, then you coast/recover too much. Outdoors, that turns into early leg debt + late suffering.

**Cadence**

- Consistently ~69–73 rpm. For long climbs, that's like doing a slow-motion leg press for an hour.
- Target: 80–90 rpm on flats, 75–85 rpm on climbs (unless it's super steep).

---

### C) Running pace trend and aerobic estimate

Runs are short, mostly hilly, and inconsistent:

- Typical pace ~8.0–8.8 min/km, faster on flatter runs (~7.5–7.9).
- With limited HR data, I'd label your current run fitness as "developing base". Running is optional for the bike goal, but useful for fat loss and general fitness if it stays easy.

---

### D) Estimated calorie burn per session (using your 86 kg)

These are estimates, but good enough for planning.

**Cycling with power** (rule of thumb: 1 kJ ≈ 1 kcal)

- Feb 9: 107 W × 88 min → 107×5280 = 565 kJ ≈ 565 kcal
- Feb 11: 85 W × 42 min → 85×2520 = 214 kJ ≈ 214 kcal
- Feb 16: 85 W × 42 min → ~214 kcal
- Feb 16: 96 W × 66 min → 96×3960 = 380 kJ ≈ 380 kcal
- Feb 19: 93 W × 63 min → 93×3780 = 351 kJ ≈ 351 kcal

**Running** (rule of thumb: ~1 kcal/kg/km)

- 4.0 km run ≈ ~344 kcal
- 5.6 km run ≈ ~482 kcal
- 3.5 km run ≈ ~301 kcal

**Walking** (rule of thumb: ~0.5 kcal/kg/km)

- 9.5 km walk ≈ ~409 kcal
- 3.1 km walk ≈ ~133 kcal
- 2.4 km walk ≈ ~103 kcal

Important: training calories help, but belly fat reduction is still mostly nutrition + daily movement (NEAT) plus consistency.

---

### E) Estimated effort levels (RPE style, since HR missing)

- Walks: low (RPE 1–3)
- Easy runs: moderate (RPE 4–6), but impact cost is real
- Virtual hilly rides: moderate to high depending on surges (RPE 5–8)
- Goal for most training: a lot of RPE 3–5, with 1–2 spicy sessions/week.

---

### F) What the data says about current fitness level

Right now you are:

- Capable of 60–90 min continuous cycling at modest power
- Under-conditioned for a 100 km hilly ride mainly due to:
  1. insufficient long-ride duration outdoors
  2. cadence too low
  3. pacing too variable
  4. historic inconsistency (now improving)

The good news: with 12 weeks, you can absolutely get to "finish strong enough to enjoy the last 20 km".

---

## 2) Tailored 12-Week Training Plan (Feb 22 → May 17)

### Training principles (the "why")

- 3 rides/week minimum, ideally 4.
- One long ride/week (progress time, then distance).
- One quality session/week (threshold-ish or hill repeats).
- Most other sessions easy (build your aerobic engine and fat-burning capacity).
- Strength 2×/week (short, consistent, cyclist-focused).
- Every 4th week deload (so you adapt instead of just collecting fatigue like Pokémon).

### Intensity guide (no HR needed)

Use RPE + talk test:

- Easy (Z2-ish): RPE 3–4, can speak in full sentences
- Tempo (Z3-ish): RPE 5–6, short sentences
- Hard (threshold): RPE 7–8, words become expensive

### Your working zones (based on FTP ~130 W)

If you want power targets (optional but useful):

- Easy: 70–85% FTP → 90–110 W
- Tempo: 85–95% FTP → 110–125 W
- Threshold intervals: 95–105% FTP → 125–140 W
- Cadence drills: keep watts easy, focus on rpm

If your indoor trainer feels "off" day to day, trust RPE first, watts second.

---

### Realistic targets by race day

- Weekly volume: build to ~4–6 hours/week most weeks; peak week ~6–8 hours.
- Long ride: progress to 3h45–4h15 with hills.
- Cadence: move your default from ~70 rpm toward 80–85 rpm.
- Pacing: reduce "NP vs avg" gap by:
  - capping climb effort at RPE 6–7 for most climbs
  - spinning easier gears earlier (don't wait until you're already bogged down)

---

### What to continue / adapt / add

**Continue**

- MyWhoosh rides: great for consistency and controlled sessions.

**Adapt**

- Add cadence drills 2–3×/week (easy watts, high rpm).
- Make hilly rides smooth rather than "attack and collapse".

**Add**

- Outdoor long rides from Week 5 onward whenever possible.
- Fuelling practice on any ride over 90 min.
- Short strength sessions twice weekly.

---

## 3) Complementary Stretching & Strength Routine (20–30 min)

### A) Mobility (8–10 min, 4–6 days/week, easy)

1. Hip flexor lunge stretch 45–60 sec/side
2. Calf stretch (straight + bent knee) 45 sec/side
3. Glute/piriformis stretch 45 sec/side
4. Thoracic opener (open book) 6 reps/side
5. Hamstring floss 10 reps/side
6. Child's pose to cobra flow 6 slow reps

### B) Strength (20–30 min, 2 days/week)

Pick a weight that feels like 2 reps left in the tank. No grinding.

**Session A (lower + core)**

- Goblet squat 3×8–10
- Romanian deadlift (DB) 3×8–10
- Split squat 2×8/side
- Plank 3×30–45 sec
- Dead bug 2×8/side

**Session B (posterior chain + stability)**

- Step-ups 3×8/side
- Hip hinge / kettlebell deadlift 3×8–10
- Glute bridge 3×10–12 (pause at top)
- Side plank 2×30–45 sec/side
- Pallof press (band) 2×10/side

**Where it fits**

- Put strength on easy ride days or after an easy ride.
- Avoid heavy legs the day before the long ride.

### C) If you keep running: quick run-specific care (5 min)

- Calf raises 2×12
- Tibialis raises 2×12 (against wall)
- Hip airplanes or single-leg balance 2×30 sec/side

---

## 4) Fat Loss Strategy (without breaking the bike build)

### A) Training structure for fat burning

- Most fat loss-friendly training is easy aerobic volume (RPE 3–4).
- Keep 1 quality bike session/week to preserve/raise fitness.
- Add steps: a daily walk is the stealth MVP for belly fat.

### B) Is your current caloric expenditure meaningful?

Right now, many sessions are 200–400 kcal, with some 500–600 kcal rides. Helpful, but not enough to outrun a generous snack culture.

Your fat loss will come from:

- A small daily deficit (about 300–500 kcal/day)
- Protein + fibre keeping hunger under control
- More weekly volume (we're building that)

### C) Nutrition timing principles (no meal plan)

- Protein: aim 1.6–2.0 g/kg/day → roughly 140–170 g/day for you.
- Carbs around key rides:
  - For intervals/long rides: eat carbs before and during so the session quality stays high.
  - Fuel long rides (non-negotiable):
    - 90 min: 30–60 g carbs/hour + water + electrolytes
    - This prevents the "bonk then binge" boomerang.
  - Easy rides can be lighter-fuelled, but don't do fasted hard sessions.
- Weigh weekly, not daily. Belly fat is a slow unglamorous exit, like a guest who insists on saying goodbye to everyone.

## A few practical "make-this-work" tips

- **Cadence hack:** shift earlier than you think. If cadence drops below ~75 rpm on a climb, shift down one more gear immediately.
- **Pacing rule for climbs:** if you can't breathe through your nose for at least part of the climb, you're probably overcooking it.
- **Consistency > perfection:** missing a session is fine; missing the pattern is the problem.

If you want, I can also turn this into a printable weekly checklist (with exact sessions per day based on your preferred training days and whether you want 0, 1, or 2 runs/week).
