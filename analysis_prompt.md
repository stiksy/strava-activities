### Cycling Power Summary (VirtualRides only — clearest power data)

| Date       | Route                    | Duration | Avg Power | Normalised Power | Cadence |
|------------|--------------------------|----------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| 2026-02-09 | Ardennes (hilly)         | 88 min   | 107 W     | 113 W            | 73 rpm  |
| 2026-02-11 | Alto del Aguila (hilly)  | 42 min   | 85 W      | 88 W             | 73 rpm  |
| 2026-02-16 | Alto del Aguila (repeat) | 42 min   | 85 W      | 88 W             | 73 rpm  |
| 2026-02-16 | Ardennes (hilly, 2nd)    | 66 min   | 96 W      | 124 W            | 69 rpm  |
| 2026-02-19 | Aerobic 12's (flat)      | 63 min   | 93 W      | 100 W            | 72 rpm  |

**Observations:**
- NP significantly higher than avg power on hilly routes → variable/surgy effort, likely not pacing well uphill
- Cadence consistently low (~69–73 rpm) — typical beginner/recreational cyclist range
- Longest ride: 88 min / 26.9 km on a hilly virtual route
- Longest outdoor ride in 6-month history: mostly commute-style 10–24 min efforts

| 2025-12-17 | Day 4   | 77 min   |

**Note:** Weight training stopped after mid-December. Sessions labelled "Day 1–4" suggest a structured 4-day programme.

## Key Observations for the Analyser

1. **Very recent positive momentum**: Weeks W07–W08 show a big jump in volume (6 activities/week, 53–56 km) after weeks of barely 1 activity — this is a new, promising trend starting ~2 weeks ago.
2. **Cycling is the primary sport**: Outdoor rides are very short (commute-style, 10–24 min), but indoor MyWhoosh sessions now reaching 60–90 min hilly efforts.
3. **Power is modest**: Avg watts range 72–111 W on rides. No FTP test data available, but based on effort at these durations, estimated FTP is likely 120–140 W.
4. **Cadence is low**: 69–73 rpm on virtual rides — inefficient, especially for long climbs.
5. **Running frequency is inconsistent**: roughly once a week when active, but weeks are often skipped entirely.
6. **Walking is supplementary**: long walks (9.5 km, 176 min on Feb 14) show willingness to move but low intensity.
7. **Weight training was structured then abandoned**: 8 sessions in Nov–Dec, then zero in Jan–Feb.
8. **No heart rate data for most activities** (monitor not worn or not synced).
9. **The event**: 100 km hilly ride in ~85 days. The longest ride so far is ~27 km virtual / probably shorter outdoors. This is a significant gap to close.

## What I'm Asking For

Please provide:

### 1. In-Depth Activity Analysis
- Trend analysis: cadence of training, consistency, load progression
- Power analysis: estimated FTP, efficiency, pacing quality (avg vs NP gap)
- Running pace trend and aerobic capacity estimate
- Estimated calorie burn per session (use body weight estimate of ~85 kg if needed)
- Estimated effort levels (low / moderate / high) per session type
- What the data says about current fitness level

### 2. Tailored 12-Week Training Plan (Feb 22 → May 17 2026)
- Week-by-week structure leading up to the 100 km hilly event on 17 May
- What to continue doing (e.g. MyWhoosh virtual rides)
- What to adapt (e.g. cadence drills, longer rides, pacing)
- What to add (e.g. longer outdoor rides, structured intervals, weight training)
- How to taper in the final 1–2 weeks before the event
- Realistic targets: weekly volume, long ride progression, power targets
- Include how to reintroduce weight training without over-fatiguing for the bike goal

### 3. Complementary Stretching & Strength Routine
- Cycling-specific mobility (hip flexors, lower back, ITB, calves)
- Core and functional strength exercises that directly support cycling and fat loss
- A simple weekly routine (time-efficient, 20–30 min sessions)
- Any running-specific mobility if running is kept in the plan

### 4. Fat Loss Strategy
- How to structure training for fat burning (zones, timing, frequency)
- Whether current caloric expenditure is meaningful and how to increase it progressively
- Nutrition timing notes around training (no detailed meal plan needed, just principles)
